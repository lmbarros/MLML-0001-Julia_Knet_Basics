# Me Learning Machine Learning, Chapter 1: Julia and Knet

In summary, I am (loosely) following the [Knet tutorial](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/README.md#Tutorial-1).

**Status:** As of now, Knet does not seem to work very well with Julia 0.6, so I am postponing the work on this for a while.
